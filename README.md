# Tetris 3D
TETRIS, but in 3D. Get it? It's just like regular tetris, but in 3 dimensions.

## Introduction
This game is programed in C#, using the unity game engine.
The scripts containing the actual game code can be found in `Tetris-3D > Assets > Scripts`.
Other game elements used (like the 3D tile models, images, etc.) can be found in the Assets folder.

## Software
Since this game is still in development and the project does not contain an executable file (yet),
I linked some software which can be used to inspect the code and run the game while its still beeing developed.

- **The Unity Game Engine**: [https://unity.com](https://unity.com/download)
- **Visual Studio** (you can use any other text editor for inspecting the code): [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Notes
This project has reached its initial release version.

It is important to note that this game was developed as part of a school project.

The reason the first commit contained so many elements is because
until the day of the first commit (29.09.2024), I had not made significant changes to the project and stored it only locally.
