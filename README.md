# Tetris 3D
Tetris 3D is a modern reimagining of the classic Tetris game, extended into three dimensions.
This project challenges players to think spatially by rotating and positioning blocks not just on a 2D grid, but within a full 3D space.

The game features many gameplay mechanics introduced in the original Tetris, such as block spawning, rotation, movement, collision detection, and line clearing.
However, it also introduces brand-new concepts that could not be achieved in two dimensions. For example, players can rotate the entire game board to better visualize the playing field.

3D models for this game were designed in [blender](https://www.blender.org/).
The project also features custom-made UI elements and animations to enhance the visual experience.

## Introduction
This game is programed in C#, using the unity game engine.
The scripts containing the actual game code can be found in `Tetris-3D > Assets > Scripts`.
Other game elements used (like the 3D tile models, images, etc.) can be found in the Assets folder.

## Software
This project now includes a ready-to-play executables. To play the game, simply visit the [latest release](https://github.com/LupusLudit/Tetris-3D/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
and download the and download the provided files.
However, if you still wish to inspect or modify the code, you may use the following software:

- **Visual Studio** (you can use any other text editor for inspecting the code): [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Notes
This project has reached its initial release version.

It is important to note that this game was developed as part of a **school project**.

The reason the first commit contained so many elements is because
until the day of the first commit (29.09.2024), I had not made significant changes to the project and stored it only locally.
