# Tetris 3D
TETRIS, but in 3D. Get it? It's just like regular tetris, but in 3 dimensions.

## Introduction
This game is programed in C#, using the unity game engine.
The scripts containing the actual game code can be found in `Tetris-3D > Assets > Scripts`.
Other game elements used can be found in the Assets folder like the 3D tile models, images, etc.

## Software
Since this game is still in development and the project does not contain an executable file (yet),
so I have linked some software which can be used to inspect the code and run the game while its still beeing developed.

- **The Unity Game Engine**: [https://unity.com](https://unity.com/download)
- **Visual Studio** (you can use any other text editor for inspecting the code): [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Notes
ðŸ¦ºBeware of the fact that this project is still in development and it is not yet finished.ðŸ¦º

It also is important to emphasize that this whole game is beeing used as a school project.

The reason, the first commit contains so many elements is because
until the day of first commit (29.09.2024), I didnÂ´t make any significant changes to the project and I stored it only localy.
